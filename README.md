Feel free to submit.

- In the "scripts" folder, you will find useful scripts I've used.
- The setup.sh script installs and configures a Kali box with some of the tools I am comfortable using. They will all reside in the "/opt/arod/" directory.
- In "useful-commands", you will find syntax that will help with certain actions you may want to do. I use these so often that I keep them there for quick reference.
